Still requires a little bit of work for trapping unusual input, but to date works for:

Create a file if it doesn't exist - set timestamp to now
	touch filename

Don't create a file if it doesn't exist - set timestamp to now
	touch -c filename

Create a file if it doesn't exist - set timestamp to 04:05:12 01/02/2011
	touch -t 201102030405.12
	touch -t 1102030405.12
	touch -t 02030405.12

Create a file if it doesn't exist - set timestamp to 04:05:00 01/02/2011
	touch -t 201102030405
	touch -t 1102030405
	touch -t 02030405
