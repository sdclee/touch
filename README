Notes

Although the original aim was to provide a windows executable capable of creating a file if one does not exist
I have gone to the trouble of makeing this both Linux and Windows compatible in compile terms.
Included in the repo should be:

	touch.c
	touch.exe (windows binary)
	touch (linux binary)

To complie in linux, simply run:

	gcc -o touch touch.c


To complie in windows, install (the beautifully lightweight tcc) and simply run:

	tcc touch.c


Still requires a little bit of work for trapping unusual input, but to date works for:

Create a file if it doesn't exist - set timestamp to now
	touch filename

Don't create a file if it doesn't exist - set timestamp to now
	touch -c filename

Create a file if it doesn't exist - set timestamp to 04:05:12 01/02/2011
	touch -t 201102030405.12
	touch -t 1102030405.12
	touch -t 02030405.12

Create a file if it doesn't exist - set timestamp to 04:05:00 01/02/2011
	touch -t 201102030405
	touch -t 1102030405
	touch -t 02030405
